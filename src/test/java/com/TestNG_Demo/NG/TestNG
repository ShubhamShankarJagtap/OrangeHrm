TESTNG: -
          It is an automation testing framework in which NG stands for "Next Generation."

          It is inspired by JUnit which uses the "ANNOTATIONS (@)."

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FEATURE'S: -

1]Web driver has no native mechanism for generating reports.So TestNg can generate the report in proper & readable format.

2]Multiple test cases can be grouped more easily.

3]Same test case can be executed multiple times without loops.

4]Using testNG you can execute multiple test cases on multiple browser's.

5]The testNG framework can be easily integrated with tools like maven,Jenkins.

6]The annotations used in testNG are very easy to understand.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

POINT'S TO BE REMEMBER.

1]TestNG does not require you have main method.

2]Methods need not to be static

3]We have to use TestNG annotations wherever necessary.

4]We have to use Assertions.

Assert class is used to conduct verification operations in testNG.

Assertions in the TestNG are way to verify the expected result matches the actual result.
